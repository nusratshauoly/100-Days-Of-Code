<!-- .1. Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers -->

<!-- 
In the HTML5 and CSS section of freeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let's go back to it. This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework.

Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>
In this case, we've already added it for you to this page behind the scenes. Note that using either > or /> to close the link tag is acceptable.

To get started, we should nest all of our HTML (except the link tag and the style element) in a div element with the class container-fluid.

Tests
Waiting:Your div element should have the class container-fluid.
Waiting:Your div element should have a closing tag.
Waiting:All HTML elements after the closing style tag should be nested in .container-fluid.
 -->



 <!-- 2. Make Images Mobile Responsive -->
 <!-- First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg.

It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.

Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page. 

Tests
Waiting:You should have a total of two images.
Waiting:Your new image should be below your old one and have the class img-responsive.
Waiting:Your new image should not have the class smaller-image.
Waiting:Your new image should have a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg.
Waiting:Your new img element should have a closing angle bracket.

-->


<!-- 3.Center Text with Bootstrap -->
<!-- 
Now that we're using Bootstrap, we can center our heading element to make it look better. All we need to do is add the class text-center to our h2 element.

Remember that you can add several classes to the same element by separating each of them with a space, like this:

<h2 class="red-text text-center">your text</h2>

Tests
Waiting:Your h2 element should be centered by applying the class text-center
Waiting:Your h2 element should still have the class red-text
-->


<!-- 4.Create a Bootstrap Button -->
<!-- 
Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.

Create a new button element below your large kitten photo. Give it the btn and btn-default classes, as well as the text of Like.

Tests
Waiting:You should create a new button element with the text Like.
Waiting:Your new button should have two classes: btn and btn-default.
Waiting:All of your button elements should have closing tags.

-->


<!-- 5.Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button -->
<!-- 
Normally, your button elements with the btn and btn-default classes are only as wide as the text that they contain. For example:

<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
This button would only be as wide as the word Submit.


By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.

<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>
This button would take up 100% of the available width.


Note that these buttons still need the btn class.

Add Bootstrap's btn-block class to your Bootstrap button.

Tests
Waiting:Your button should still have the btn and btn-default classes.
Waiting:Your button should have the class btn-block.
Waiting:All of your button elements should have closing tags.
-->


<!-- 6.Taste the Bootstrap Button Color Rainbow -->

<!-- 
The btn-primary class is the main color you'll use in your app. It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take.

Replace Bootstrap's btn-default class with btn-primary in your button.

Note that this button will still need the btn and btn-block classes.

Tests
Your button should have the class btn-primary.
Waiting:Your button should still have the btn and btn-block classes.
Waiting:All your button elements should have closing tags.
-->

<!-- 7. Call out Optional Actions with btn-info-->
<!-- 
Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-info class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.

Create a new block-level Bootstrap button below your Like button with the text Info, and add Bootstrap's btn-info class to it.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.

Tests
Waiting:You should create a new button element with the text Info.
Waiting:Both of your Bootstrap buttons should have the btn and btn-block classes.
Waiting:Your new button should have the class btn-info.
Waiting:All of your button elements should have closing tags.
-->

<!-- 8.Warn Your Users of a Dangerous Action with btn-danger  -->
<!-- 
Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-danger class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a cat photo.

Create a button with the text Delete and give it the class btn-danger.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.

Tests
Waiting:You should create a new button element with the text Delete.
Waiting:All of your Bootstrap buttons should have the btn and btn-block classes.
Waiting:Your new button should have the class btn-danger.
Waiting:All of your button elements should have closing tags.

-->



<!-- 9.Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side By Side
 -->
 <!-- 
Bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.

Bootstrap has different column width attributes that it uses depending on how wide the user's screen is. For example, phones have narrow screens, and laptops have wider screens.

Take for example Bootstrap's col-md-* class. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.

In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use col-xs-*, where xs means extra small (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), and * is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be.

Put the Like, Info and Delete buttons side-by-side by nesting all three of them within one <div class="row"> element, then each of them within a <div class="col-xs-4"> element.

The row class is applied to a div, and the buttons themselves can be nested within it.

Tests
Waiting:Your buttons should all be nested within the same div element with the class row.
Waiting:Each of your Bootstrap buttons should be nested within its own div element with the class col-xs-4.
Waiting:Each of your button elements should have a closing tag.
Waiting:Each of your div elements should have a closing tag.

-->



<!-- 10.Ditch Custom CSS for Bootstrap -->
<!-- 
We can clean up our code and make our Cat Photo App look more conventional by using Bootstrap's built-in styles instead of the custom styles we created earlier.

Don't worry - there will be plenty of time to customize our CSS later.

Delete the .red-text, p, and .smaller-image CSS declarations from your style element so that the only declarations left in your style element are h2 and thick-green-border.

Then delete the p element that contains a dead link. Then remove the red-text class from your h2 element and replace it with the text-primary Bootstrap class.

Finally, remove the smaller-image class from your first img element and replace it with the img-responsive class.

Tests
Waiting:Your h2 element should no longer have the class red-text.
Waiting:Your h2 element should now have the class text-primary.
Waiting:Your paragraph elements should no longer use the font Monospace.
Waiting:The smaller-image class should be removed from your top image.
Waiting:You should add the img-responsive class to your top image.

-->


<!-- 11. Use a span to Target Inline Elements -->

<!-- 
You can use spans to create inline elements. Remember when we used the btn-block class to make the button fill the entire row?



That illustrates the difference between an "inline" element and a "block" element.

By using the inline span element, you can put several elements on the same line, and even style different parts of the same line differently.

Using a span element, nest the word love inside the p element that currently has the text Things cats love. Then give the span the class text-danger to make the text red.

Here's how you would do this for the p element that has the text Top 3 things cats hate:

<p>Top 3 things cats <span class="text-danger">hate:</span></p>

Tests
Your span element should be inside your p element.
Waiting:Your span element should have just the text love.
Waiting:Your span element should have class text-danger.
Waiting:Your span element should have a closing tag.

-->


<!-- 12. Create a Custom Heading-->
<!-- 
We will make a simple heading for our Cat Photo App by putting the title and relaxing cat image in the same row.

Remember, Bootstrap uses a responsive grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.

Nest your first image and your h2 element within a single <div class="row"> element. Nest your h2 element within a <div class="col-xs-8"> and your image in a <div class="col-xs-4"> so that they are on the same line.

Notice how the image is now just the right size to fit along the text?

Tests
Waiting:Your h2 element and topmost img element should both be nested together within a div element with the class row.
Waiting:Your topmost img element should be nested within a div with the class col-xs-4.
Waiting:Your h2 element should be nested within a div with the class col-xs-8.
Waiting:All of your div elements should have closing tags.


-->



<!-- 13. Add Font Awesome Icons to our Buttons -->
<!-- 
Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons can be webfonts or vector graphics. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.

You can include Font Awesome in any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-50oBUHEmvpQ+1lW4y57PTFmhCaXp0ML5d60M1M7uH2+nqUivzIebhndOJK28anvf" crossorigin="anonymous">
In this case, we've already added it for you to this page behind the scenes.

The i element was originally used to make other elements italic, but is now commonly used for icons. You can add the Font Awesome classes to the i element to turn it into an icon, for example:

<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
Note that the span element is also acceptable for use with icons.

Use Font Awesome to add a thumbs-up icon to your like button by giving it an i element with the classes fas and fa-thumbs-up. Make sure to keep the text Like next to the icon.

Tests
Waiting:You should add an i element with the classes fas and fa-thumbs-up.
Waiting:Your fa-thumbs-up icon should be located within the Like button.
Waiting:Your i element should be nested within your button element.
Waiting:Your icon element should have a closing tag.

-->


<!-- 14.Add Font Awesome Icons to all of our Buttons -->
<!-- 
Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons can be web fonts or vector graphics. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.

Use Font Awesome to add an info-circle icon to your info button and a trash icon to your delete button.

Note: The span element is an acceptable alternative to the i element for the directions below.

Tests
Waiting:You should add a <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> within your info button element.
Waiting:You should add a <i class="fas fa-trash"></i> within your delete button element.
Waiting:Each of your i elements should have a closing tag and <i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i> is in your like button element.
-->



<!-- 15. Responsively Style Radio Buttons -->

<!-- You can use Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes on form elements, too! This way, our radio buttons will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.

Nest both your radio buttons within a <div class="row"> element. Then nest each of them within a <div class="col-xs-6"> element.

Note: As a reminder, radio buttons are input elements of type radio.

Tests
Waiting:All of your radio buttons should be nested inside one div with the class row.
Waiting:Each of your radio buttons should be nested inside its own div with the class col-xs-6.
Waiting:All of your div elements should have closing tags.
-->



<!-- 16. Responsively Style Checkboxes-->
<!-- 
    Since Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes are applicable to all form elements, you can use them on your checkboxes too! This way, the checkboxes will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.

Nest all three of your checkboxes in a <div class="row"> element. Then nest each of them in a <div class="col-xs-4"> element.

Tests
Waiting:All of your checkboxes should be nested inside one div with the class row.
Waiting:Each of your checkboxes should be nested inside its own div with the class col-xs-4.
Waiting:All of your div elements should have closing tags.
 -->



 <!-- 17.Style Text Inputs as Form Controls
 -->
 <!-- 
You can add the fa-paper-plane Font Awesome icon by adding <i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> within your submit button element.

Give your form's text input field a class of form-control. Give your form's submit button the classes btn btn-primary. Also give this button the Font Awesome icon of fa-paper-plane.

All textual <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements with the class .form-control have a width of 100%.

Tests
Waiting:The submit button in your form should have the classes btn btn-primary.
Waiting:You should add a <i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> within your submit button element.
Waiting:The text input in your form should have the class form-control.
Waiting:Each of your i elements should have a closing tag.
-->



<!-- 18.Line up Form Elements Responsively with Bootstrap -->
<!-- 
Now let's get your form input and your submission button on the same line. We'll do this the same way we have previously: by using a div element with the class row, and other div elements within it using the col-xs-* class.

Nest both your form's text input and submit button within a div with the class row. Nest your form's text input within a div with the class of col-xs-7. Nest your form's submit button in a div with the class col-xs-5.

This is the last challenge we'll do for our Cat Photo App for now. We hope you've enjoyed learning Font Awesome, Bootstrap, and responsive design!

Tests
Waiting:Your form submission button and text input should be nested in a div with class row.
Waiting:Your form text input should be nested in a div with the class col-xs-7.
Waiting:Your form submission button should be nested in a div with the class col-xs-5.
Waiting:All of your div elements should have closing tags.

-->


<!-- 19.Create a Bootstrap Headline -->
<!-- 
Now let's build something from scratch to practice our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.

We'll build a jQuery playground, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenges.

To start with, create an h3 element, with the text jQuery Playground.

Color your h3 element with the text-primary Bootstrap class, and center it with the text-center Bootstrap class.

Tests
Waiting:You should add an h3 element to your page.
Waiting:Your h3 element should have a closing tag.
Waiting:Your h3 element should be colored by applying the class text-primary
Waiting:Your h3 element should be centered by applying the class text-center
Waiting:Your h3 element should have the text jQuery Playground.
-->


<!-- 20. House our page within a Bootstrap container-fluid div -->
<!-- 
Now let's make sure all the content on your page is mobile-responsive.

Let's nest your h3 element within a div element with the class container-fluid.

Tests
Waiting:Your div element should have the class container-fluid.
Waiting:Each of your div elements should have closing tags.
Waiting:Your h3 element should be nested inside a div element.
-->


<!-- 21. Create a Bootstrap Row -->
<!-- 
Now we'll create a Bootstrap row for our inline elements.

Create a div element below the h3 tag, with a class of row.

Tests
Waiting:You should add a div element below your h3 element.
Waiting:Your div element should have the class row
Waiting:Your row div should be nested inside the container-fluid div
Waiting:Your div element should have a closing tag.
-->


<!-- 22. Split Your Bootstrap Row -->
<!-- 
Now that we have a Bootstrap Row, let's split it into two columns to house our elements.

Create two div elements within your row, both with the class col-xs-6.

Tests
Waiting:Two div class="col-xs-6" elements should be nested within your div class="row" element.
Waiting:All your div elements should have closing tags.

-->



<!-- 23. Create Bootstrap Wells -->
<!-- 
Bootstrap has a class called well that can create a visual sense of depth for your columns.

Nest one div element with the class well within each of your col-xs-6 div elements.

Tests
Waiting:You should add a div element with the class well inside each of your div elements with the class col-xs-6
Waiting:Both of your div elements with the class col-xs-6 should be nested within your div element with the class row.
Waiting:All your div elements should have closing tags.

-->



<!-- 24.Add Elements within Your Bootstrap Wells -->
<!-- 
Now we're several div elements deep on each column of our row. This is as deep as we'll need to go. Now we can add our button elements.

Nest three button elements within each of your div elements having the class name well.

Tests
Waiting:Three button elements should be nested within each of your div elements with class well.
Waiting:You should have a total of 6 button elements.
Waiting:All of your button elements should have closing tags.
-->




<!-- 25. Apply the Default Bootstrap Button Style-->
<!-- Bootstrap has another button class called btn-default.

Apply both the btn and btn-default classes to each of your button elements.

Tests
Waiting:You should apply the btn class to each of your button elements.
Waiting:You should apply the btn-default class to each of your button elements.
-->



<!-- 26. Create a Class to Target with jQuery Selectors-->
<!-- 
Not every class needs to have corresponding CSS. Sometimes we create classes just for the purpose of selecting these elements more easily using jQuery.

Give each of your button elements the class target.

Tests
Waiting:You should apply the target class to each of your button elements.
-->



<!-- 27. Add id Attributes to Bootstrap Elements-->
<!-- 
Recall that in addition to class attributes, you can give each of your elements an id attribute.

Each id must be unique to a specific element and used only once per page.

Let's give a unique id to each of our div elements of class well.

Remember that you can give an element an id like this:

<div class="well" id="center-well">
Give the well on the left the id of left-well. Give the well on the right the id of right-well.

Tests
Waiting:Your left well should have the id of left-well.
Waiting:Your right well should have the id of right-well.
-->




<!-- 28. Label Bootstrap Wells-->
<!-- 
For the sake of clarity, let's label both of our wells with their ids.

Above your left-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #left-well.

Above your right-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #right-well.

Tests
Waiting:You should add an h4 element to each of your <div class="col-xs-6"> elements.
Waiting:One h4 element should have the text #left-well.
Waiting:One h4 element should have the text #right-well.
Waiting:All of your h4 elements should have closing tags.
-->



<!-- 29.Give Each Element a Unique id -->
<!-- We will also want to be able to use jQuery to target each button by its unique id.

Give each of your buttons a unique id, starting with target1 and ending with target6.

Make sure that target1 to target3 are in #left-well, and target4 to target6 are in #right-well.

Tests
Waiting:One button element should have the id target1.
Waiting:One button element should have the id target2.
Waiting:One button element should have the id target3.
Waiting:One button element should have the id target4.
Waiting:One button element should have the id target5.
Waiting:One button element should have the id target6.

 -->


 <!-- 30. Label Bootstrap Buttons-->
 <!-- Just like we labeled our wells, we want to label our buttons.

Give each of your button elements text that corresponds to its id selector.

Tests
Waiting:Your button element with the id target1 should have the text #target1.
Waiting:Your button element with the id target2 should have the text #target2.
Waiting:Your button element with the id target3 should have the text #target3.
Waiting:Your button element with the id target4 should have the text #target4.
Waiting:Your button element with the id target5 should have the text #target5.
Waiting:Your button element with the id target6 should have the text #target6.
-->



<!-- 31. Use Comments to Clarify Code-->
<!-- When we start using jQuery, we will modify HTML elements without needing to actually change them in HTML.

Let's make sure that everyone knows they shouldn't actually modify any of this code directly.

Remember that you can start a comment with <!-- and end a comment with -->

Add a comment at the top of your HTML that says Code below this line should not be changed

Tests
Waiting:You should start a comment with <!-- at the top of your HTML.
Waiting:Your comment should have the text Code below this line should not be changed.
Waiting:You should close your comment with -->.
Waiting:You should have the same number of comment openers and closers.
-->
